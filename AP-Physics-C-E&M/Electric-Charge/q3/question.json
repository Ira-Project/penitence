  "Question": "A neutral metal sphere is placed between two charged parallel metal plates. One plate has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge. What will be the charge on the sphere after equilibrium? Draw the charges on the sphere.",
  "Question_image": "",
  "Answer": ["No overall charge", "The sphere will have a negative charge on the side closer to the positive plate and a positive charge on the side closer to the negative plate"],
