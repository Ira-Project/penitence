A neutron converts to a proton.\n*   **Beta Plus Decay:** Emission of a positron and a neutrino.  A proton converts to a neutron.\n*   **Gamma Decay:** Emission of a gamma ray photon; the nucleus transitions to a lower energy state.\n*   **Decay Series:** A sequence of radioactive decays until a stable nucleus is reached.\n*   **Random and Spontaneous:** Radioactive decay is random (unpredictable) and spontaneous (unaffected by external conditions).\n*   **Half-Life (T<sub>1/2</sub>):** The time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.\n*   **Decay Constant (\u03bb):** The probability of decay per unit time. $\\lambda = \\frac{0.693}{T_{1/2}}$\n*   **Activity (A):** The rate of decay, measured in Becquerels (Bq): $A = \\lambda N$.  $A = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$.\n\n**5. Fundamental Forces**\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Interaction:** Acts on charged particles; infinite range; given by Coulomb's law.\n*   **Strong Nuclear Interaction:** Acts on protons and neutrons, holding them together in the nucleus; short range (\u2248 10<sup>-15</sup> m).\n*   **Weak Nuclear Interaction:** Involved in beta decay; very short range.\n*   **Gravitational Interaction:** Acts on particles with mass; infinite range (but negligible in nuclear physics).\n",
