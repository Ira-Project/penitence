    "chapter_text": "Here's a concise summary of the concepts covered in the document, organized into sections with bullet points and associated formulas where applicable:\n\n**1. Kinematics Basics**\n\n*   **Position:**  A vector quantity defining the location of an object.\n*   **Displacement:** Change in position $\\Delta s = s_{final} - s_{initial}$.\n*   **Distance:**  The total length of the path traveled.\n*   **Velocity:** Rate of change of displacement.  In uniform motion, $v = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}$.\n*   **Average Speed:** Total distance traveled divided by the time taken.\n*   **Uniform Motion:**  Motion with constant velocity. Position is given by $s = s_0 + vt$.\n\n**2. Non-Uniform Motion**\n\n*   **Average Velocity:**  $v = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}$.\n*   **Instantaneous Velocity:**  $v = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}$.  (Gradient of position-time graph).\n*   **Acceleration:** Rate of change of velocity, $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$.  (Gradient of velocity-time graph).\n\n**3. Uniformly Accelerated Motion**\n\n*   **Constant Acceleration:**\n*   $v = u + at$\n*   $\\Delta s = (\\frac{u+v}{2})t$\n*   $\\Delta s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$\n*   $v^2 = u^2 + 2a\\Delta s$\n\n**4. Graphical Analysis of Motion**\n\n*   **Position-Time Graph:** Gradient represents velocity.\n*   **Velocity-Time Graph:** Gradient represents acceleration; Area under the curve represents displacement.\n*   **Acceleration-Time Graph:** Area under the curve represents change in velocity.\n\n**5. Projectile Motion**\n\n*   **Independent Horizontal and Vertical Motion:** Analyze motion in each direction separately.\n*   **Horizontal Motion:**  Constant velocity (no acceleration).  $x = u_x t$.\n*   **Vertical Motion:** Uniform acceleration due to gravity. $v_y = u_y - gt$, $y = u_y t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$.\n*   **Initial Velocity Components:** $u_x = u \\cos{\\theta}$,  $u_y = u \\sin{\\theta}$\n*   **Maximum Height:** $y_{max} = \\frac{u^2 \\sin^2{\\theta}}{2g}$\n*   **Range:** $x = \\frac{u^2 \\sin{2\\theta}}{g}$\n\n**6. Fluid Resistance (Air Resistance)**\n\n*   **Fluid Resistance Force:**  Opposes motion through a fluid (gas or liquid). Typically $F = kv$ (low speeds) or $F=kv^2$ (high speeds).\n*   **Terminal Speed:**  The constant speed reached when fluid resistance equals weight. $v_T = \\frac{mg}{k}$.\n",
