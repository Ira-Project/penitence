    "chapter_text": "Here's a breakdown of the concepts from the provided text, organized into sections with bullet points:\n\n**1. Standing Waves & Resonance**\n\n*   **Standing Wave Formation:**  Occurs when two identical waves travelling in opposite directions meet and interfere based on the principle of superposition. Crests stay in the same place.\n*   **Nodes:** Points where the displacement is always zero due to destructive interference.\n*   **Antinodes:** Points halfway between nodes where the displacement reaches its maximum due to constructive interference.\n*   **Characteristics of Standing Waves:**\n    *   Amplitude of oscillation is different at different points on the string.\n    *   Doesn't transfer energy.\n    *   Ends are either nodes or antinodes (boundary conditions).\n\n**2. Standing Waves on Strings**\n\n*   **Harmonics:** Different standing wave patterns established on a string, depending on the frequency used.\n    *   First Harmonic: Longest wavelength, lowest frequency.\n    *   Higher Harmonics:  More loops, shorter wavelengths, and higher frequencies.\n\n*   **Relationships between wavelength (\u03bb), String length (L) and frequency (f):**\n\n    *   For string fixed at both ends: \n        *   Wavelength:  $\\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n}$, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4...\n        *   Frequency: $f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda}$\n\n**3. Standing Waves in Pipes**\n\n*   **Open at Both Ends (Antinode-Antinode):**\n     *   Wavelength : $\\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n}$, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4...\n\n*   **One End Closed, One End Open (Node-Antinode):**\n     *  Wavelength : $\\lambda_n = \\frac{4L}{n}$, where n = 1, 3, 5,...\n\n**4. Resonance and Damping**\n\n*   **Free Oscillations:** Oscillations without loss of energy or externally applied forces (amplitude is constant).\n*   **Damping:** Loss of energy in an oscillating system due to resistance forces. In light damping, amplitude decreases exponentially with time.\n*   **Forced/Driven Oscillations:** Oscillations that occur due to an externally applied force ($F$) which varies periodically with driving frequency (f). The natural frequency of the system is $f_0$.\n*   **Resonance:** Condition where the driving frequency (f) equals the natural frequency ($f_0$) of the system, resulting in maximum amplitude of oscillations.\n*   **Critical Damping:** System returns to equilibrium in the shortest possible time without oscillations.\n*   **Overdamping:** System returns to equilibrium slowly without oscillations.\n\n",
