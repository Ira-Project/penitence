If $F_{net} = 0$, it follows that $\\Delta p = 0$\n\n*   **Extension: The Rocket Equation**\n    * The expression of the speed of the change in rocket speed as a result of fuel ejecting with speed $u$:\n    $\\delta v = \\frac{u \\delta m}{M}$\n\n*   **4.4 Kinetic Energy and Momentum**\n    *   Kinetic Energy in terms of momentum: $E_k = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$\n    *   Elastic Collision: Kinetic energy is conserved.\n    *   Inelastic Collision: Kinetic energy is not conserved.\n        *   Totally Inelastic: Bodies stick together after collision; maximum kinetic energy is lost.\n*    **4.5 Two-dimensional collisions**\n    * Collision in a two dimensional space where the momentum of the objects is summed based on the initial direction of the movement.\n\n",
