    "chapter_text": "Here's a summary of the concepts covered in the provided material, organized into sections with bullet points and LaTeX formulas:\n\n**1. Rutherford Experiment and Atomic Structure:**\n\n*   **Rutherford's Model of the Atom:** An atom consists of a small, massive, positively charged nucleus orbited by electrons.\n*   **Geiger-Marsden-Rutherford Experiment:** Alpha particles were directed at a thin gold foil. Observations of scattering angles led to the development of Rutherford's model.\n*   Small deflections of alpha particles due to repulsion between positive charge of gold atoms and alpha particles.\n*   Infrequent large-angle scatterings implied concentrated positive charge in a small nucleus.\n\n**2. Discrete Energy Levels and Spectra:**\n\n*   **Discrete Energy Levels:** Atoms can only possess specific energy values. Represented by energy level diagrams.\n*   **Emission Spectra:** The set of wavelengths emitted by a gas when excited.\n*   **Absorption Spectra:** The set of wavelengths absorbed by a gas. The dark lines correspond to wavelengths absorbed by gas atoms.\n*   **Photon Emission:**  An atom makes a transition from a higher to lower energy state by emitting a photon.\n*   **Photon Energy:**  The energy of a photon is related to its frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb) by the following equations:\n    *   $E = hf$\n    *   $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\n**3. Bohr Model of Hydrogen:**\n\n*   **Bohr Model:** Applied to the hydrogen atom, leading to quantized energy levels.\n*   **Energy Levels in Hydrogen:**  The energy of the hydrogen atom in the nth state:\n    *   $E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2} \\text{ eV}$\n\n*   **Quantization of Angular Momentum:** Bohr assumed electrons exist in special orbits satisfying the condition:\n\n    *   $mvr = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\n\n* **Bohr Radius:**\n    * $ a = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2 k e^2 m}$\n\n**4. Redshift and Hubble's Law:**\n\n* Hubble discovered that spectral lines from distant galaxies showed a redshift.\n\n**5. Energy and Electric Field:**\n*   Electric Field Calculation:\n    *   $ E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}$\n",
