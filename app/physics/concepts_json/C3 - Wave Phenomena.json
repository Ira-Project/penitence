    "chapter_text": "Here's a summary of the concepts discussed, structured into sections with bullet points and relevant formulas:\n\n**1. Wavefronts and Rays**\n\n*   **Wavefronts:** Planes normal to the direction of wave propagation representing crests of waves.\n*   **Rays:** Lines at right angles to wavefronts indicating the direction of energy transfer.\n\n**2. Reflection**\n\n*   **Law of Reflection:** The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\n**3. Refraction**\n\n*   Refraction occurs when a wave passes from one medium to another where its speed changes, altering its direction.\n*   Frequency remains constant during refraction, but wavelength changes.\n*   **Snell's Law:** \\[\\frac{\\sin \\theta_1}{c_1} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta_2}{c_2}\\]\n*   **Refractive Index:**  \\(n = \\frac{c}{v}\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum and \\(v\\) is the speed in the medium.\n*   Snell's Law with Refractive Indices: \\[n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2\\]\n*   **Total Internal Reflection:** Occurs when a wave in a denser medium hits a boundary with a less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle.\n\n**4. Principle of Superposition**\n\n*   The displacement of a medium at a point where two or more waves overlap is the algebraic sum of the individual displacements.\n\n**5. Diffraction**\n\n*   Diffraction is the spreading of a wave as it passes an obstacle or through an aperture.\n*   Diffraction is more significant when the wavelength is comparable to the size of the aperture.\n\n**6. Double-Source Interference**\n\n*   **Constructive Interference:** Occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n    \\[|S_1P - S_2P| = n\\lambda,  n = 0,1,2,3,...\\]\n*   **Destructive Interference:** Occurs when the path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength.\n    \\[|S_1P - S_2P| = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda, n = 0,1,2,3,...\\]\n\n**7. Young's Two-Slit Experiment**\n\n*   Plane wavefronts of light approach two thin, parallel slits, resulting in an interference pattern on a screen.\n*   Condition for constructive interference: \\(d \\sin \\theta = n\\lambda, n=0, \\pm1, \\pm2, ...\\)\n*   Condition for destructive interference: \\(d \\sin \\theta = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda, n = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2,...\\)\n* Small angle approximation: \\(\\sin \\theta \\approx \\tan \\theta \\approx \\theta\\).\n*   Position of maxima from the center of the screen: \\(s = \\frac{n \\lambda D}{d}\\)\n*   Fringe separation: \\(s = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}\\), where \\(D\\) is the distance to the screen and \\(d\\) is the slit separation.\n\n**8. Single-Slit Diffraction**\n\n* When a wave passes through a single slit of width \\(b\\), diffraction occurs.\n* Condition for the first minimum:  \\(b\\sin \\theta = \\lambda\\)\n* Angle of the first diffraction minimum: \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{b}\\)\n\n**9. Multiple Slits**\n\n*   As the number of slits increases, the interference pattern becomes more complex.\n\n**10. Diffraction Grating**\n\n*   Consists of a large number of parallel slits.\n* Condition for constructive interference: \\(d \\sin \\theta = n\\lambda, n=0, \\pm1, \\pm2, ...\\), where \\(d\\) is the slit separation and \\(n\\) is the order of the maximum.\n",
