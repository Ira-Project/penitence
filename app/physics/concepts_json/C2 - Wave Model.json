    "chapter_text": "Here is a concise summary of the concepts covered in the provided text, organized into sections with bullet points and associated formulas:\n\n**1. Wave Fundamentals**\n\n*   **Mechanical Waves:** Disturbances that travel through a medium, transferring energy and momentum. The direction of propagation is the direction of energy transfer.\n*   **Wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)):** The length of one full wave.  It is the distance from crest to crest or trough to trough.\n*   **Period (T):** The time to create one full wave.\n*   **Frequency (f):** The number of full waves created in one second. The relationship between frequency and period is:\n    *   \\(f = \\frac{1}{T}\\)\n*   **Wave Speed (v):**  The speed at which energy is transferred. It depends on the properties of the medium.\n    *   \\(v = f\\lambda\\)\n*   **Amplitude (A):** The maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position.\n\n**2. Types of Waves**\n\n*   **Transverse Waves:** Waves where the displacement of the medium's particles is at right angles to the direction of energy transfer.\n*   **Longitudinal Waves:** Waves where the displacement of the medium's particles is parallel to the direction of energy transfer. These involve compressions (regions of higher density and pressure) and rarefactions (regions of lower density and pressure).\n\n**3. Wave Properties**\n\n*   **Phase Difference (\\(\\Delta\\phi\\)):**  Describes the relative displacement of two points in a wave (or two waves).\n    *   For waves separated in time: \\(\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi \\frac{\\Delta t}{T}\\), where \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time separation.\n    *   For waves separated in distance: \\(\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(\\Delta x\\) is the distance separation.\n\n**4. Electromagnetic Waves**\n\n*   **Nature:** Transverse waves consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, propagating in vacuum at the speed of light.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):**  \\(c = 299,792,458 \\ m/s \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\ m/s\\)\n*   **Production:** Produced by accelerating electric charges.\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *  \\(c = f\\lambda\\)\n\n**5. Sound Waves**\n\n*   **Nature:** Longitudinal waves consisting of compressions and rarefactions.\n*   **Medium:** Can travel through gases, liquids, and solids.\n\n**6. Other Wave Types**\n\n*   **Gravitational Waves:** Transverse waves predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Generated by accelerating massive objects.\n*   **Matter Waves:** Waves associated with particles, described by quantum theory.  These are waves of probability.",
