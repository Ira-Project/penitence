    "chapter_text": "Here are the concepts covered in the text, organized into sections:\n\n**1. Radiation from Real Bodies**\n\n*   **Emissivity (e):** A measure of how well a real body radiates compared to a black body at the same temperature. It's a value between 0 and 1.\n\n*   **Intensity (I):** The power radiated per unit area.  Formula: \\(I = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4\\)\n\n*   **Albedo (\u03b1):** The ratio of the reflected intensity (or power) to the incident intensity (or power). It's a measure of how reflective a body is.\n\n    *   Relationship between emissivity and albedo: \\(\\epsilon + \\alpha = 1\\) (for bodies that only absorb or reflect)\n    \n*   **Net Power Radiated (Pnet):**  The rate at which energy leaves the body, considering both emission and absorption from surroundings at temperature \\(T_s\\). Formula: \\(P_{net} = \\epsilon \\sigma A(T^4 - T_s^4)\\)\n\n**2. Solar Constant and Earth's Energy Balance**\n\n*   **Solar Constant (S):** The intensity of solar radiation at the top of the earth's atmosphere, approximately 1400 W m\u207b\u00b2.\n\n*   **Intensity (I):** General definition as power per unit area: \\(I = \\frac{P}{4 \\pi d^2}\\)\n\n*   **Average Intensity Received by Earth (\\(I_{av}\\)):** Accounting for the Earth's spherical shape, it's one-fourth of the solar constant. Formula:  \\(I_{av} = (1 - \\alpha)\\frac{S}{4}\\)\n\n*   **Energy Balance Equation:** At equilibrium, the intensity received by the earth equals the intensity radiated by the earth.\n    * The intensity radiated = \\(\\sigma T^4\\)\n* **Equilibrium Temperature of the earth:** The temperature attained when energy input equals energy output.\n\n**3. Greenhouse Effect**\n\n*   **Greenhouse Effect:** Warming of the earth due to the absorption and re-radiation of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n*   **Greenhouse Gases:** Gases in the atmosphere that absorb infrared radiation (e.g., water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide).\n\n*   **Enhanced Greenhouse Effect:** Additional warming due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activities.\n\n*   **Mechanism of Photon Absorption:** Greenhouse gases absorb infrared photons, become excited, and then re-emit photons in all directions, including back towards the earth.\n\n    *   **Resonance:**  Photons are absorbed when their frequency matches the natural frequency of oscillation of the greenhouse gas molecules.",
